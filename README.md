# AppleThinningVRHandInteraction
VR Hand Interaction sandbox for testing functionality to interact with objects in VR using hand controls


## Build and Export
To Build this application and run on the quest simply follow this video up to 5:12 minutes in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBot3ff1TCc

A few differences in our setup
- When setting the export options, for the VR Option keep  OpenXR selected instead of changing it to the oculus mobile VRapi (at 4:21 in the video)

Now to build the app and send it to the Oculus Quest 2 simply click the android icon next to the play/pause/stop buttons in the top right of the Godot editor.

Because this app requires hand tracking, you are unable to click the play button and simply run on your computer.
